Found the error in the program!  Predictions are not 100% anymore – closer to 50%.  This is much closer to expected with this data set.  Also, I have added new features and tested the network predictions with two homemade test data sets.  Am not adapting for the CIFAR data sets.  Will post when ready.

These are data collected for an experiment to identify changes in the 
response properties of single neurons in the dorsal cochlear nucleus that 
may serve as a neural correlate of tinnitus.  The justification, methods 
and data analyses can be found here.  The dataset consists of 998 observations.
Each observation consists of 114 features including identifying information, 
response type, location and LTE II d-prime and flagged by population (tinnitus 
or normal).    

Contemporary machine learning techniques rely on very large training data sets 
in order to make accurate predictions.  Our data are comparatively tiny, 
nevertheless we were interested in seeing how well this class of models might 
do on a binary test.  We eliminated systematic differences between data sets 
are generally uninteresting for the question at hand.  For instance the 
procedure used to induce tinnitus created a clear dependence on best frequency 
(BF) that is not expected to be associated with the condition.  We eliminated 
BF from the training and test data sets.  The identifying information (e.g.
experiment date) was similarly eliminated. 

This is an ongoing project and more will be added.  Thus far, we have 
implemented two classes of architecture.  A dense neural net (DNN), modeled 
after the iris data in the Tensorflow programmer tutorials and several 
convolutional neural networks (CNN), modeled after the Tensorboard tutorial.  
Behavior of the CNNs is too good, achieving 100% accuracy after less 
the 1000 training epochs – need to investigate.  The network graph is shown above.
The accuracy of the DNNs were not as good, never achieving 100% accuracy even 
after 10,000 training epochs.

It is curious that the models do so well on this task since the data 
are biological.  This is a scientific experiment so, it is possible that an 
important feature was our ability to focus the data sets to include only the 
important features.  We will explore this possibility by looking at the 
features that made the largest contribution and by trying different model 
architectures.  For instance, we are currently implementing capsule nets.
